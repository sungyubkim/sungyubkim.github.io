I'm a researcher in the LLM team @ **AI Center, Samsung Electronics**. I received my Ph.D. from KAIST, where I studied machine learning and deep learning theory.

## Research Interests

- **Post-hoc Analysis & Adaptation of Foundation Models**: Developing methods to analyze and adapt pre-trained large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for downstream tasks without full retraining.
- **Explainability and Interpretability**: Understanding the internal mechanisms of foundation models to improve transparency and trustworthiness.
- **Generalization via Loss Landscape**: Investigating the generalization properties of deep neural networks through the lens of loss landscape geometry and optimization dynamics.
- **Efficient ML Systems**: Exploring distributed training, sequence parallelism, and memory-efficient attention mechanisms for scaling large models.
