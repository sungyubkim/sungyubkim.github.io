I'm a researcher in the LLM team @ **AI Center, Samsung Electronics**.

My research interest includes:
- Post-hoc analysis & adaptation of Foundation models (e.g., Large-Language Models and Vision-Language Models).
- Explainability and interpretability of Foundation models.
- Generalization of Foundation models via the lens of loss landscape.

For more details, see my [CV](/cv/).
